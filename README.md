Collection of Brazilian Blogspot Posts

Diary-like content expressing the authors experiences and sentiments over a variety of personal topics is generated every day and made available on the Internet . This rich content can be used for psychological analysis and knowledge discovery in several ways. This paper presents the creation of a standard Brazilian Portuguese annotated corpus, using blog posts for personal stories detection. We also perform an analysis of psycholinguistic categories across story and non-story posts, discussing their similarities and differences and the obstacles when using them as classifying features. We describe the evaluation of several machine learning approaches and the process of applying them to identify  personal stories in our dataset.
